Installation Steps:

1. Download the appropriate Instant Client packages for your platform. All installations REQUIRE the Basic or Basic Lite package.

2. Unzip the packages into a single directory such as "instantclient".

3. Set the library loading path in your environment to the directory in Step 2 ("instantclient"). 
On many UNIX platforms, LD_LIBRARY_PATH is the appropriate environment variable. On Windows, PATH should be used.
==> mettre le package, dans la variable d'environnement : PATH
==> cr√©er le folder : "tnsnames" contenant le fichier tnsnames.ora. 

4. Start your application and enjoy.
